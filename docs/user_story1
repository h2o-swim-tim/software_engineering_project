User's first time login

There will be two ways to login for the first time: one for those with both Spotify and Google accounts, and one for those with only Google accounts (in which
the app can direct the user to create their own free Spotify account to save the curated playlists). The user will also have the option to sign in to Spotify 
as well so that the playlists can be saved to their personal accounts. We will be using each API's authentication and permission 
requirements. Google will ask the user to accept sharing permissions with the entire Google account for the calendar and an authentication email can 
be sent to the email registered. The calendar will be remembered so that this process will only be performed on the first time logging in. In case 
the process fails, the user can restart their initial login – whether the reason be forgotten passwords (so that the user can use Google's password recovery
features) or internet connection issues.
