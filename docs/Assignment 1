IDEA 1: Spotify playlist based on hours logged in Google Calendar

We will pull information about the next day on Google Calendar regarding the number of hours the user is busy. Based on the number of hours the next day, a formula 
will be developed to determine the amount of hours the user should study/work for that day. A playlist on Spotify will be created of the determined length with
appropriate songs.

IDEA 2: Women-owned businesses will be cross referenced with Yelp

We will cross check Boston's women-owned businessees with their Yelp pages. This will help support women-owned businesses that are highly rated on Yelp, as well 
as give users a way to make an informed decision. The user will have the ability to choose which category of business they want to see or a curated list will be 
provided.
