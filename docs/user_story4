User Story 4: A user who is already logged into Spotify and Google is creating a playlist





The user goes into the application and is logged into Spotify and Google. They will choose a "Create New Playlist" button. 


This will begin the process to access the user's Google calendar for the following day (beginning at 12:00am and ending at 11:59pm).


The application will add up the total time of their events.


The application will ask the user what mood they want their playlist to be (TBD).


Using the mood information, the application will create a playlist within their account of songs within that genre that reaches the total time of events (within a certain margin of error in minutes).


The playlist will be named by the application and be in the form of (mm/dd - mood).


This playlist will be created in the user's account, so once the songs have been added and the playlist has been named, it will be saved.


We will have a success message for the user along the lines of "your playlist is ready!"





If the process fails, we will give them an error and ask them to create the playlist again
