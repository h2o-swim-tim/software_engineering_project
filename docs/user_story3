User Story 3: A user who is not logged into Spotify but is logged into Google is creating a playlist





The user goes into the application and is logged into Google, but not Spotify. They will choose a "Create New Playlist" button. 


This will begin the process to access the user's Google calendar for the following day (beginning at 12:00am and ending at 11:59pm).


The application will add up the total time of their events.


The application will ask the user what mood they want their playlist to be (TBD).


Using the mood information, the application will create a playlist within their account of songs within that genre that reaches the total time of events (within a certain margin of error in minutes).


The playlist will be named by the application and be in the form of (mm/dd - mood).


This playlist will be created in an account owned by the application, and a sharing link to the playlist will be given.

Because we do not want an extremely large number of playlists being created and stored by the account, we will have a setting where they can select how long they'd like to keep the playlist saved for (with a limit of perhaps a week).

If the user would like to keep the playlist for longer than a week, we will direct them to sign in with Spotify. 

If they sign in from that page with Spotify, we will create the same playlist on their account.

We will have a success message for the user along the lines of "your playlist is ready!"

If the process fails, we will give them an error and ask them to create the playlist again
